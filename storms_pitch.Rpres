The data used is a subset of the NOAA Atlantic hurricane database best track data. The data includes the positions and attributes of 198 tropical storms, measured every six hours during the lifetime of a storm.

The variable names of the data are:
```{r}
names(storms)
```

The number of observations are:
```{r}
nrow(storms)
```

Data Products
========================================================

Shiny application for exploring the data can be found here:

Shiny Application
========================================================

Shiny application for viewing the data consists of a select box for filtering
the name of the storm, a map for displaying the data tracks and a data table
for showing the details of the track. Selecting different storm name from the
input updates the map and data shown. Full application looks like this:

```
